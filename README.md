# CS201 – Student Registry System

## Project Overview
This project implements a command-line student registry system in Java.
The system manages students, courses, and grades using text files.

## Functional Requirements
- Load data from text files
- Find records by unique keys
- Query records using conditions
- Add new students, courses, and grades
- Generate reports in CSV, JSON, and XML formats

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Efficient execution for large datasets
- Low memory usage
- Fast response time

## Design & Implementation
The system is designed using object-oriented principles.
Each entity (Student, Course, Grade) is represented as a class.
Business logic is separated from input/output handling.

## Error Handling
The program validates all inputs and handles missing or invalid data
by displaying appropriate error messages.

## Conclusion
The project meets the requirements of the assignment.
